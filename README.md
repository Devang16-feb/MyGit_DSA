# Data Structures: LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Searching And Sorting

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures including LinkedList, Stack, and Queue.

## LinkedList

A LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.

# Data Structures

## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The list is traversed starting from the head (the first node) and follows the links until the end (where the next node is null).

## Circular Singly Linked List
A circular singly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circle. This allows for continuous traversal of the list.

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. This bidirectional linkage allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

## Circular Doubly Linked List
A circular doubly linked list is similar to a doubly linked list, but the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node, creating a circular structure. This allows for continuous bidirectional traversal.

## Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added to and removed from the top of the stack. Common operations are `push` (add an element) and `pop` (remove an element).

## Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). It is commonly used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved.


### Features:
- Dynamic size
- Ease of insertion/deletion

### Operations:
1. **InsertFirst**: Adds a new node at the beginning.
2. **InsertLast**: Adds a new node at the end.
3. **DeleteFirst**: Removes the first node.
4. **DeleteLast**: Removes the last node.
5. **Display**: Displays all the nodes in the list.
6. **Count**: Count number of elements in list.
7. **InsertAtPos**: Insert the element at specific position.
8. **DeleteAtPos**: Delete the element at specific positon.
9. **BubbleSort**: Compares All Elements one by one and sort them.
10. **InsertionSort**: Each element in array cheacked with previus elements.
11. **SelectionSort**: First find Smallest element in the array and swap element with respective position.
12. **ShellSort**: It is an n-gap Insertion sort.
